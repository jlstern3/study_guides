<h3>Defining Terms</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Fork (a remote, server-side copy of a repo -- distinct from the original)</li>
    <li>Clone (local copy of a remote repo)</li>
    <li> *** So forking a repo that you don't own creates a copy of that repo on your GitHub profile.  
        You can then clone that fork to get a copy of the repo on your local machine.</li>
</ol>
